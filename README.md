# VAI-RWorkshop-2024
Accessing documents from VAI R workshop 2024

This 2-part workshop is meant to teach fundamental concepts in R and RStudio, with a focus on new R users. We will start with the basics: how to access the platform and common jargon. This will be followed by a guided tour of some essential tools found in base R and an introduction to R packages. Participants will then learn to import data and explore different data structures, explained in terms of their specific applications. We will conclude with a brief introduction to the Tidyverse with examples of data wrangling and different visualizations according to variable type. At the end of this workshop series users will have a solid foundation to begin importing, exploring, and visualizing their own data in R/R Studio
